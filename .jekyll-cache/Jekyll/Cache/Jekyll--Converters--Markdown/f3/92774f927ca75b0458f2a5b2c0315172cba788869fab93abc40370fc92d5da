<h1 id="title">1997 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
</h1><br />
<h4>Effective May 1, 2020
</h4><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part1">RULE 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS</h3>
<br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Title of the Rules.</em> ‚Äî These Rules shall be known and cited as the Rules of Court. (1)
</p><br />

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Cases governed.</em> ‚Äî These Rules shall govern the procedure to be observed in actions, civil or criminal, and special proceedings.
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) A civil action is one by which a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong. (1a, R2) A civil action may either be ordinary or special. Both are governed by the rules for ordinary civil actions, subject to the specific rules prescribed for a special civil action. (n)

(b) A criminal action is one by which the State prosecutes a person for an act or omission punishable by law. (n)

(c) A special proceeding is a remedy by which a party seeks to establish a status, a right, or a particular fact. (2a, R2)
</pre>
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. In what cases not applicable.</em> ‚Äî These Rules shall not apply to election cases, land registration, cadastral, naturalization and insolvency proceedings, and other cases not herein provided for, except by analogy or in a suppletory character and whenever practicable and convenient. (R143a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. Commencement of action.</em> ‚Äî A civil action is commenced by the filing of the original complaint in court. If an additional defendant is impleaded in a later pleading, the action is commenced with regard to him on the date of the filing of such later pleading, irrespective of whether the motion for its admission, if necessary, is denied by the court. (6a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 6. Construction.</em> ‚Äî These Rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding. (2a)
</p><br />

<br /><br />

<h2 id="part2">CIVIL ACTIONS<br />
ORDINARY CIVIL ACTIONS
</h2><br />

<br /><br />

<h3>RULE 2: CAUSE OF ACTION
</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Ordinary civil actions, basis of.</em> ‚Äî Every ordinary civil action must be based on a cause of action. (n)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 2. Cause of action, defined.</em> ‚Äî A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another. (n)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. One suit for a single cause of action.</em> ‚Äî A party may not institute more than one suit for a single cause of action. (3a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. Splitting a single cause of action; effect of.</em> ‚Äî If two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, the filing of one or a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a ground for the dismissal of the others. (4a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. Joinder of causes of action.</em> ‚Äî A party may in one pleading assert, in the alternative or otherwise, as many causes of action as he may have against an opposing party, subject to the following conditions:
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) The party joining the causes of action shall comply with the rules on joinder of parties;

(b) The joinder shall not include special civil actions or actions governed by special rules;

(c) Where the causes of action are between the same parties but pertain to different venues or jurisdictions, the joinder may be allowed in the Regional Trial Court provided one of the causes of action falls within the jurisdiction of said court and the venue lies therein; and

(d) Where the claims in all the causes of action are principally for recovery of money, the aggregate amount claimed shall be the test of jurisdiction. (5a)
</pre>
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 6. Misjoinder of causes of action.</em> ‚Äî Misjoinder of causes of action is not a ground for dismissal of an action. A misjoined cause of action may, on motion of a party or on the initiative of the court, be severed and proceeded with separately. (n)
</p><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part3">RULE 3: PARTIES TO CIVIL ACTIONS
</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Who may be parties; plaintiff and defendant.</em> ‚Äî Only natural or juridical persons, or entities authorized by law may be parties in a civil action. The term ‚Äúplaintiff‚Äù may refer to the claiming party, the counter-claimant, the cross-claimant, or the third (fourth, etc.)‚Äîparty plaintiff. The term ‚Äúdefendant‚Äù may refer to original defending party, the defendant in a counterclaim, the cross-defendant, or the third (fourth etc.)‚Äîparty defendant. (1a).
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 2. Parties in interest.</em> ‚Äî A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest. (2a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Representatives as parties.</em> ‚Äî Where the action is allowed to be prosecuted or defended by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest. A representative may be a trustee of an express trust, a guardian, an executor or administrator, or a party authorized by law or these Rules. An agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued without joining the principal except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal. (3a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. Spouses as parties.</em> ‚Äî Husband and wife shall sue or be sued jointly, except as provided by law. (4a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. Minor or incompetent persons.</em> ‚Äî A minor or a person alleged to be incompetent, may sue or be sued, with the assistance of his father, mother, guardian, or if he has none, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>. (5a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 6. Permissive joinder of parties.</em> ‚Äî All persons in whom or against whom any right to relief in respect to or arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions is alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally, or in the alternative, may, except as otherwise provided in these Rules, join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in one complaint, where any question of law or fact common to all such plaintiffs or to all such defendants may arise in the action; but the court may make such orders as may be just to prevent any plaintiff or defendant from being embarrassed or put to expense in connection with any proceedings in which he may have no interest.(6)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 7. Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties.</em> ‚Äî Parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants. (7)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 8. Necessary party.</em> ‚Äî A necessary party is one who is not indispensable but who ought to be joined as a party if complete relief is to be accorded as to those already parties, or for a complete determination or settlement of the claim subject of the action. (8a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 9. Non-joinder of necessary parties to be pleaded.</em> ‚Äî Whenever in any pleading in which a claim is asserted a necessary party is not joined, the pleader shall set forth his name, if known, and shall state why he is omitted. Should the court find the reason for the omission unmeritorious, it may order the inclusion of the omitted necessary party if jurisdiction over his person may be obtained.
<br /><br />
The failure to comply with the order for his inclusion, without justifiable cause, shall be deemed a waiver of the claim against such party.
<br /><br />
The non-inclusion of a necessary party does not prevent the court from proceeding in the action, and the judgment rendered therein shall be without prejudice to the rights of such necessary party. (8a, 9a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 10. Unwilling co-plaintiff.</em> ‚Äî If the consent of any party who should be joined as plaintiff can not be obtained, he may be made a defendant and the reason therefor shall be stated in the complaint. (10)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 11. Misjoinder and non-joinder of parties.</em> ‚Äî Neither misjoinder nor non-joinder of parties is ground for dismissal of an action. Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just. Any claim against a misjoined party may be severed and proceeded with separately. (11a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 12. Class suit.</em> ‚Äî When the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons so numerous that it is impracticable to join all as parties, a number of them which the court finds to be sufficiently numerous and representative as to fully protect the interests of all concerned may sue or defend for the benefit of all. Any party in interest shall have the right to intervene to protect his individual interest. (12a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 13. Alternative defendants.</em> ‚Äî Where the plaintiff is uncertain against who of several persons he is entitled to relief, he may join any or all of them as defendants in the alternative, although a right to relief against one may be inconsistent with a right of relief against the other. (13a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 14. Unknown identity or name of defendant.</em> ‚Äî Whenever the identity or name of a defendant is unknown, he may be sued as the unknown owner, heir, devisee, or by such other designation as the case may require; when his identity or true name is discovered, the pleading must be amended accordingly. (14)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 15. Entity without juridical personality as defendant.</em> ‚Äî When two or more persons not organized as an entity with juridical personality enter into a transaction, they may be sued under the name by which they are generally or commonly known.
<br /><br />
In the answer of such defendant, the names and addresses of the persons composing said entity must all be revealed. (15a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC 16. Death of party; duty of counsel.</em> ‚Äî Whenever a party to a pending action dies, and the claim is not thereby extinguished, it shall be the duty of his counsel to inform the court within thirty (30) days after such death of the fact thereof, and to give the name and address of his legal representative or representatives. Failure of counsel to comply with this duty shall be a ground for disciplinary action.
<br /><br />
The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to be substituted for the deceased, without requiring the appointment of an executor or administrator and the court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the minor heirs.
<br /><br />
The court shall forthwith order said legal representative or representatives to appear and be substituted within a period of thirty (30) days from notice.
<br /><br />
If no legal representative is named by the counsel for the deceased party, or if the one so named shall fail to appear within the specified period, the court may order the opposing party, within a specified time, to procure the appointment of an executor or administrator for the estate of the deceased and the latter shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the deceased. The court charges in procuring such appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs. (16a, 17a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 17. Death or separation of a party who is a public officer.</em> ‚Äî When a public officer is a party in an action in his official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action may be continued and maintained by or against his successor if, within thirty (30) days after the successor takes office or such time as may be granted by the court, it is satisfactorily shown to the court by any party that there is a substantial need for continuing or maintaining it and that the successor adopts or continues or threatens to adopt or continue the action of his predecessor. Before a substitution is made, the party or officer to be affected, unless expressly assenting thereto, shall be given reasonable notice of the application therefor and accorded an opportunity to be heard. (18a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 18. Incompetency or incapacity.</em> ‚Äî If a party becomes incompetent or incapacitated, the court, upon motion with notice, may allow the action to be continued by or against the incompetent or incapacitated person assisted by his legal guardian or guardian <i>ad litem</i>. (19a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 19. Transfer of interest.</em> ‚Äî In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. (20)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 20. Action on contractual money claims.</em> ‚Äî When the action is for recovery of money arising from contract, express or implied, and the defendant dies before entry of final judgment in the court in which the action was pending at the time of such death, it shall not be dismissed but shall instead be allowed to continue until entry of final judgment. A favorable judgment obtained by the plaintiff therein shall be enforced in the manner especially provided in these Rules for prosecuting claims against the estate of a deceased person. (21a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 21. Indigent party.</em> ‚Äî A party may be authorized to litigate his action, claim or defense as an indigent if the court, upon an <i>ex parte</i> application and hearing, is satisfied that the party is one who has no money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic necessities for himself and his family.
<br /><br />
Such authority shall include an exemption from payment of docket and other lawful fees, and of transcripts of stenographic notes which the court may order to be furnished him. The amount of the docket and other lawful fees which the indigent was exempted from paying shall be a lien on any judgment rendered in the case favorable to the indigent, unless the court otherwise provides.
<br /><br />
Any adverse party may contest the grant of such authority at any time before judgment is rendered by the trial court. If the court should determine after hearing that the party declared as an indigent is in fact a person with sufficient income or property, the proper docket and other lawful fees shall be assesed and collected by the clerk of court. If payment is not made within the time fixed by the court, execution shall issue or the payment thereof, without prejudice to such other sanctions as the court may impose. (22a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC 22. Notice to the Solicitor General.</em> ‚Äî In any action involving the validity of any treaty, law, ordinance, executive order, presidential decree, rules or regulations, the court, in its discretion, may require the appearance of the Solicitor General who may be heard in person or through a representative duly designated by him. (23a)
</p><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part4">RULE 4: VENUE OF ACTIONS
</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Venue of real actions.</em> ‚Äî Actions affecting title to or possession of real property, or interest therein, shall be commenced and tried in the proper court which has jurisdiction over the area wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated.
<br /><br />
Forcible entry and detainer actions shall be commenced and tried in the municipal trial court of the municipality or city wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated. (1[a], 2[a]a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 2. Venue of personal actions.</em> ‚Äî All other actions may be commenced and tried where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendants resides, or in the case of a non-resident defendant where he may be found, at the election of the plaintiff. (2[b]a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Venue of actions against nonresidents.</em> ‚Äî If any of the defendants does not reside and is not found in the Philippines, and the action affects the personal status of the plaintiff, or any property of said defendant located in the Philippines, the action may be commenced and tried in the court of the place where the plaintiff resides, or where the property or any portion thereof is situated or found. (2[c]a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. When Rule not applicable.</em> ‚Äî This Rule shall not apply-

</p><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part5">RULE 5: UNIFORM PROCEDURE IN TRIAL COURTS
</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Uniform procedure.</em> ‚Äî The procedure in the Municipal Trial Courts shall be the same as in the Regional Trial Courts, except

</p><br />

<br /><br />

<h2>PROCEDURE IN REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS
</h2><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part6">RULE 6: KINDS OF PLEADINGS
</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Pleadings defined.</em> ‚Äî Pleadings are the written statements of the respective claims and defenses of the parties submitted to the court for appropriate judgment. (1)</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 2. Pleadings allowed.</em> ‚Äî The claims of a party are asserted in a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, third (fourth, etc.)-party complaint, or complaint-in-intervention.
<br />
The defenses of a party are alleged in the answer to the pleading asserting a claim against him or her.
<br />
An answer may be responded to by a reply only if the defending party attaches an actionable document to the answer. (2a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Complaint.</em> ‚Äî The complaint is the pleading alleging the plaintiff's or claiming party's cause or causes of action. The names and residences of the plaintiff and defendant must be stated in the complaint. (3a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. Answer.</em> ‚Äî An answer is a pleading in which a defending party sets forth his or her defenses. (4a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. Defenses.</em> ‚Äî Defenses may either be negative or affirmative.
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) A negative defense is the specific denial of the material fact or facts alleged in the pleading of the claimant essential to his or her cause or causes of action.

(b) An affirmative defense is an allegation of a new matter which, while hypothetically admitting the material allegations in the pleading of the claimant, would nevertheless prevent or bar recovery by him or her. The affirmative defenses include fraud, statute of limitations, release, payment, illegality, statute of frauds, estoppel, former recovery, discharge in bankruptcy, and any other matter by way of confession and avoidance.
Affirmative defenses may also include grounds for the dismissal of a complaint, specifically, that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, or that the action is barred by a prior judgement. (5a)
</pre>
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 6. Counterclaim.</em> ‚Äî A counterclaim is any claim which a defending party may have against an opposing party. (6)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 7. Compulsory counterclaim.</em> ‚Äî A compulsory counterclaim is one which, being cognizable by the regular courts of justice, arises out of or is connected with the transaction or occurrence constituting the subject matter of the opposing party‚Äôs claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Such a counterclaim must be within the jurisdiction of the court both as to the amount and the nature thereof, except that in an original action before the Regional Trial Court, the counterclaim may be considered compulsory regardless of the amount. A compulsory counterclaim not raised in the same action is barred, unless otherwise allowed by these Rules. (7a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 8. Cross-claim.</em> ‚Äî A cross-claim is any claim by one party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter either of the original action or of a counterclaim therein. Such cross-claim may cover all or part of the original claim. (8a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 9. Counter-counterclaims and counter-cross-claims.</em> ‚Äî A counterclaim may be asserted against an original counter-claimant.
<br /><br />
A cross-claim may also be filed against an original cross-claimant. (n)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 10. Reply.</em> ‚Äî All new matters alleged in the answer are deemed controverted. If the plaintiff wishes to interpose any claims arising out of the new matters so alleged, such claims shall be set forth in an amended or supplemental complaint. However, the plaintiff may file a reply only if the defending party attaches an actionable document to his or her answer.
<br /><br />
A reply is a pleading, the office or function of which is to deny, or allege facts in denial or avoidance of new matters alleged in, or relating to, said actionable document.
<br /><br />
In the event of an actionable document attached to the reply, the defendant may file a rejoinder if the same is based solely on an actionable document. (10a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 11.

<br /><br />
If a cause of action or defense relied on is based on law, the pertinent provisions thereof and their applicability to him or her shall be clearly and concisely stated. (1a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 2. Alternative causes of action or defenses.</em> ‚Äî A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in one cause of action or defense or in separate causes of action or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. (2)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Conditions precedent.</em> ‚Äî In any pleading, a general averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent shall be sufficient. (3)
</p><br />

An authenticated copy of the judgement or decision shall be attached to the pleading. (6a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 7. Action or defense based on document.</em> ‚Äî Whenever an action or defense is based upon a written instrument or document, the substance of such instrument or document shall be set forth in the pleading, and the original or a copy thereof shall be attached to the pleading as an exhibit, which shall be deemed to be a part of the pleading. (7a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 8. How to contest such documents.</em> ‚Äî When an action or defense is founded upon a written instrument, or attached to the corresponding pleading as provided in the preceding section, the genuineness and due execution of the instrument shall be deemed admitted unless the adverse party, under oath specifically denies them, and sets forth what he or she claims to be the facts; but the requirement of an oath does not apply when the adverse party does not appear to be a party to the instrument or when compliance with an order for an inspection of the original instrument is refused. (8a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 9. Official document or act.</em> ‚Äî In pleading an official document or official act, it is sufficient to aver that the document was issued or the act was done in compliance with law. (9)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 10. Specific denial.</em> ‚Äî A defendant must specify each material allegation of fact the truth of which he or she does not admit and, whenever practicable, shall set forth the substance of the matters upon which he or she relies to support his or her denial. Where a defendant desires to deny only a part of an averment, he or she shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Where defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of a material averment made to the complaint, he or she shall so state, and this shall have the effect of a denial. (10a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 11. Allegations not specifically denied deemed admitted.</em> ‚Äî Material averments in a pleading asserting a claim or claims, other than those as to the amount of unliquidated damages shall be deemed admitted when not specifically denied. (11a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 12. Affirmative defenses.</em> -
<br />
(a) A defendant shall raise his or her affirmative defenses in his or her answer, which shall be limited to the reasons set forth under Sections5(b), Rule 6, and the following grounds:
<br /><br />
<pre>
1. That the court has no jurisdiction over the person of the defending party;

2. That the venue is improperly laid;

3. That the plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue;

4. That the pleading asserting the claim states no cause of action; and

5. That a condition precedent for filing the claim has not been complied with.
</pre></p><br />
<p>(b) Failure to raise the affirmative defenses at the earliest opportunity shall constitute a waiver thereof.
<br /><br />
(c) The court shall <i>motu proprio</i> resolve the above affirmative defenses within thirty (30) calendar days from the filing of the answer.
<br /><br />
(d) As to the affirmative defenses under the first paragraph of Section5(b), Rule 6, the court may conduct a summary hearing within fifteen(15) calendar days from the filing of the answer. Such affirmative defenses shall be resolved by the court within thirty (30) calendar days from the termination of the summary hearing.
<br /><br />
(e) Affirmative defenses, if denied, shall not be the subject of a motion for reconsideration or petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition or <i>mandamus</i>, but may be among the matters to be raised on appeal or after judgement on the merits. (n)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 13. Striking out of pleading or matter contained therein.</em> ‚Äî Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these Rules, upon motion made by a party within twenty (20) calendar days after the service of the pleading upon him or her, or upon the court‚Äôs own initiative at any time, the court may order any pleading to be stricken out or that any sham or false, redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter be stricken out therefrom. (12a)
</p><br />

<h3 id="part9">RULE 9: EFFECT OF FAILURE TO PLEAD
</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Defenses and objections not pleaded.</em> ‚Äî Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived. However, when it appears from the pleadings or the evidence on record that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, or that the action is barred by a prior judgment or by statute of limitations, the court shall dismiss the claim. (1)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC.2. Compulsory counterclaim, or cross-claim, not set up barred.</em> ‚Äî A compulsory counterclaim or a cross-claim not set up shall be barred. (2)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Default; Declaration of.</em> ‚Äî If the defending party fails to answer within the time allowed therefor, the court shall, upon motion of the claiming party with notice to the defending party, and proof of such failure, declare the defending party in default. Thereupon, the court shall proceed to render judgment granting the claimant such relief as his or her pleading may warrant, unless the court in its discretion requires the claimant to submit evidence. Such reception of evidence may be delegated to the clerk of court.
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) Effect of order of default.‚Äî A party in default shall be entitled to notice of subsequent proceedings but shall not take part in the trial.

(b) Relief from order of default. ‚Äî A party declared in default may at any time after notice thereof and before judgment, file a motion under oath to set aside the order of default upon proper showing that his or her failure to answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence and that he or she has a meritorious defense. In such case, the order of default may be set aside on such terms and conditions as the judge may impose in the interest of justice.

(c) Effect of partial default. ‚Äî When a pleading asserting a claim states a common cause of action against several defending parties, some of whom answer and the others fail to do so, the court shall try the case against all upon the answers thus filed and render judgment upon the evidence presented.

(d) Extent of relief to be awarded.‚Äî A judgment rendered against a party in default shall neither exceed the amount or be different in kind from that prayed for nor award unliquidated damages.

(e) Where no defaults allowed.‚Äî If the defending party in action for annulment or declaration of nullity of marriage or for legal separation fails to answer, the court shall order the Solicitor General or his or her deputized public prosecutor, to investigate whether or not a collusion between the parties exists, and if there is no collusion, to intervene for the State in order to see to it that the evidence submitted is not fabricate.

<br /><br />
<pre>
1. Mark their respective evidence if not yet marked in the judicial affidavits of their witnesses;

Appearance of Parties.</em> ‚Äî It shall be the duty of the parties and their counsel to appear at the pre-trial, court-annexed mediation, and judicial dispute resolution, if necessary.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. Effect of failure to appear.</em> ‚Äî When duly notified, the failure of the plaintiff and counsel to appear without valid cause when so required pursuant to the next preceding Section, shall cause the dismissal of the action. The dismissal shall be with prejudice, unless otherwise ordered by the court. A similar failure on the part of the defendant and counsel shall be cause to allow the plaintiff to present his or her evidence <i>ex-parte</i> within ten (10) calendar days from termination of the pre-trial, and the court to render judgment on the basis of the evidence offered. (5a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 6. Pre-trial brief.</em> ‚Äî The parties shall file with the court and serve on the adverse party, in such manner as shall ensure their receipt thereof at least three (3) calendar days before the date of the pre-trial, their respective pre-trial briefs which shall contain, among others:

The party who caused the postponement is warned that the presentation of its evidence must still be terminated within the remaining dates previously agreed upon.
<br /><br />
Should the opposing party fail to appear without valid cause stated in the next preceding paragraph, the presentation of the scheduled witness will proceed with the absent party being deemed to have waived the right to interpose objection and conduct cross-examination.

The sheriff shall sell only a sufficient portion of the personal or real property of the judgment obligor which has been levied upon.
When there is more property of the judgment obligor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and lawful fees, he must sell only so much of the personal or real property as is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and lawful fees.

The garnishment shall cover only such amount as will satisfy the judgment and all lawful fees.
The garnishee shall make a written report to the court within five (5) days from service of the notice of garnishment stating whether or not the judgment obligor has sufficient funds or credits to satisfy the amount of the judgment. If not, the report shall state how much funds or credits the garnishee holds for the judgment obligor. The garnished amount in cash, or certified bank check issued in the name of the judgment obligee, shall be delivered directly to the judgment obligee within ten (10) working days from service of notice on said garnishee requiring such delivery, except the lawful fees which shall be paid directly to the court.
In the event there are two or more garnishees holding deposits or credits sufficient to satisfy the judgment, the judgment obligor, if available, shall have the right to indicate the garnishee or garnishees who shall be required to deliver the amount due; otherwise, the choice shall be made by the judgment obligee.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 15. Notice of sale of property on execution.</em> ‚Äî Before the sale of property on execution, notice thereof must be given as follows:
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) In case of perishable property, by posting written notice of the time and place of the sale in three (3) public places, preferably in conspicuous areas of the municipal or city hall, post office and public market in the municipality or city where the sale is to take place, for such time as may be reasonable, considering the character and condition of the property;

(c) In case of real property, by posting for twenty (20) days in the three (3) public places above-mentioned a similar notice particularly describing the property and stating where the property is to be sold, and if the assessed value of the property exceeds fifty thousand (P50,000.00) pesos, by publishing a copy of the notice once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in one newspaper selected by raffle, whether in English, Filipino, or any major regional language published, edited and circulated or, in the absence thereof, having general circulation in the province or city;

(d) In all cases, written notice of the sale shall be given to the judgment obligor, at least three (3) days before the sale, except as provided in paragraph (a) hereof where notice shall be given at any time before the sale, in the same manner as personal service of pleadings and other papers as provided by section 6 of Rule 13.

<p>The notice shall specify the place, date and exact time of the sale which should not be earlier than nine o‚Äôclock in the morning and not later than two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon.

In the case of personal property capable of manual delivery, the sale shall be held in the place where the property is located. (18a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 16. Proceedings where property claimed by third person.</em> ‚Äî If the property levied on is claimed by any person other than the judgment obligor or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and serves the same upon the officer making the levy and a copy thereof upon the judgment obligee, the officer shall not be bound to keep the property, unless such judgment obligee, on demand of the officer, files a bond approved by the court to indemnify the third-party claimant in a sum not less than the value of the property levied on. In case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be determined by the court issuing the writ of execution. No claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be enforced against the bond unless the action therefor is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.
<br /><br />
The officer shall not be liable for damages for the taking or keeping of the property, to any third-party claimant if such bond is filed. Nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any third person from vindicating his claim to the property in a separate action, or prevent the judgment obligee from claiming damages in the same or a separate action against a third-party claimant who filed a frivolous or plainly spurious claim.
<br /><br />
When the writ of execution is issued in favor of the Republic of the Philippines, or any officer duly representing it, the filing of such bond shall not be required, and in case the sheriff or levying officer is sued for damages as a result of the levy, he shall be represented by the Solicitor General and if held liable therefor, the actual damages adjudged by the court shall be paid by the National Treasurer out of such funds as may be appropriated for the purpose. (17a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 17. Penalty for selling without notice, or removing or defacing notice.</em> ‚Äî An officer selling without the notice prescribed by section 15 of this Rule shall be liable to pay punitive damages in the amount of five thousand (P5,000.00) pesos to any person injured thereby, in addition to his actual damages, both to be recovered by motion in the same action; and a person willfully removing or defacing the notice posted, if done before the sale, or before the satisfaction of the judgment if it be satisfied before the sale, shall be liable to pay five thousand (P5,000.000) pesos to any person injured by reason thereof, in addition to his actual damages, to be recovered by motion in the same action. (19a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 18. No sale if judgment and costs paid.</em> ‚Äî At any time before the sale of property on execution, the judgment obligor may prevent the sale by paying the amount required by the execution and the costs that have been incurred therein. (20a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 19. How property sold on execution; who may direct manner and order of sale.</em> ‚Äî All sales of property under execution must be made at public auction, to the highest bidder, to start at the exact time fixed in the notice. After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more shall be sold and any excess property or proceeds of the sale shall be promptly delivered to the judgment obligor or his authorized representative, unless otherwise directed by the judgment or order of the court. When the sale is of real property, consisting of several known lots, they must be sold separately; or, when a portion of such real property is claimed by a third person, he may require it to be sold separately. When the sale is of personal property capable of manual delivery, it must be sold within view of those attending the same and in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price. The judgment obligor, if present at the sale, may direct the order in which property, real or personal, shall be sold, when such property consists of several known lots or parcels which can be sold to advantage separately. Neither the officer conducting the execution sale, nor his deputies, can become a purchaser, nor be interested directly or indirectly in any purchase at such sale. (21a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 20. Refusal of purchaser to pay.</em> ‚Äî If a purchaser refuses to pay the amount bid by him for property struck off to him at a sale under execution, the officer may again sell the property to the highest bidder and shall not be responsible for any loss occasioned thereby; but the court may order the refusing purchaser to pay into the court the amount of such loss, with costs, and may punish him for contempt if he disobeys the order. The amount of such payment shall be for the benefit of the person entitled to the proceeds of the execution, unless the execution has been fully satisfied, in which event such proceeds shall be for the benefit of the judgment obligor. The officer may thereafter reject any subsequent bid of such purchaser who refuses to pay. (22a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 21. Judgment obligee as purchaser.</em> ‚Äî When the purchaser is the judgment obligee, and no third-party claim has been filed, he need not pay the amount of the bid if it does not exceed the amount of his judgment. If it does, he shall pay only the excess. (23a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 22. Adjournment of sale.</em> ‚Äî By written consent of the judgment obligor and obligee, or their duly authorized representatives, the officer may adjourn the sale to any date and time agreed upon by them. Without such agreement, he may adjourn the sale from day to day if it becomes necessary to do so for lack of time to complete the sale on the day fixed in the notice or the day to which it was adjourned. (24a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 23. Conveyance to purchaser of personal property capable of manual delivery.</em> ‚Äî When the purchaser of any personal property, capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase price, the officer making the sale must deliver the property to the purchaser and, if desired, execute and deliver to him a certificate of sale.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 24. Conveyance to purchaser of personal property not capable of manual delivery.</em> ‚Äî When the purchaser of any personal property, not capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase price, the officer making the sale must execute and deliver to the purchaser a certificate of sale.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 25. Conveyance of real property; certificate thereof given to purchaser and filed with registry of deeds.</em> ‚Äî Upon a sale of real property, the officer must give to the purchaser a certificate of sale containing:
<br /><br />

(b) The price paid for each distinct lot or parcel;

(c) The whole price paid by him;

(d) A statement that the right of redemption expires one (1) year from date of the registration of the certificate of sale.
</pre></p><br />
<p>Such certificate must be registered in the registry of deeds of the place where the property is situated. (27a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 26. Certificate of sale where property claimed by third person.</em> ‚Äî When a property sold by virtue of a writ of execution has been claimed by a third person, the certificate of sale to be issued by the sheriff pursuant to sections 23, 24 and 25 of this Rule shall make express mention of the existence of such third-party claim. (28a)

Time and manner of, and amounts payable on, successive redemptions; notice to be given and filed.</em> ‚Äî The judgment obligor, or redemptioner, may redeem the property from the purchaser, at any time within one (1) year from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale, by paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase, with one <i>per centum</i> per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser may have paid thereon after purchase, and interest on such last named amount at the same rate; and if the purchaser be also a creditor having a prior lien to that of the redemptioner, other than the judgment under which such purchase was made, the amount of such other lien, with interest.
<br /><br />
Property so redeemed may again be redeemed within sixty (60) days after the last redemption upon payment of the sum paid on the last redemption, with two <i>per centum</i> thereon in addition, and the amount of any assessments or taxes which the last redemptioner may have paid thereon after redemption by him, with interest on such last-named amount, and in addition, the amount of any liens held by said last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest. The property may be again, and as often as a redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner within sixty (60) days after the last redemption, on paying the sum paid on the last previous redemption, with two <i>per centum</i> thereon in addition, and the amounts of any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption thereon, with interest thereon, and the amount of any liens held by the last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest.
<br /><br />
Written notice of any redemption must be given to the officer who made the sale and a duplicate filed with the registry of deeds of the place, and if any assessments or taxes are paid by the redemptioner or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice thereof must in like manner be given to the officer and filed with the registry of deeds; if such notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments, taxes, or liens. (30a)
</p><br />

Effect of redemption by judgment obligor, and a certificate to be delivered and recorded thereupon; to whom payments on redemption made.</em> ‚Äî If the judgment obligor redeems, he must make the same payments as are required to effect a redemption by a redemptioner, whereupon, no further redemption shall be allowed and he is restored to his estate. The person to whom the redemption payment is made must execute and deliver to him a certificate of redemption acknowledged before a notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of conveyances of real property. Such certificate must be filed and recorded in the registry of deeds of the place in which the property is situated, and the registrar of deeds must note the record thereof on the margin of the record of the certificate of sale. The payments mentioned in this and the last preceding sections may be made to the purchaser or redemptioner, or for him to the officer who made the sale. (31a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 30. Proof required of redemptioner.</em> ‚Äî A redemptioner must produce to the officer, or person from whom he seeks to redeem, and serve with his notice to the officer a copy of the judgment or final order under which he claims the right to redeem, certified by the clerk of the court wherein the judgment or final order is entered; or, if he redeems upon a mortgage or other lien, a memorandum of the record thereof, certified by the registrar of deeds; or an original or certified copy of any assignment necessary to establish his claim; and an affidavit executed by him or his agent, showing the amount then actually due on the lien. (32a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 31. Manner of using premises pending redemption; waste restrained.</em> ‚Äî Until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption, the court may, as in other proper cases, restrain the commission of waste on the property by injunction, on the application of the purchaser or the judgment obligee, with or without notice; but it is not waste for a person in possession of the property at the time of the sale, or entitled to possession afterwards, during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it in the same manner in which it was previously used; or to use it in the ordinary course of husbandry; or to make the necessary repairs to buildings thereon while he occupies the property.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 33. Deed and possession to be given at expiration of redemption period; by whom executed or given.</em> ‚Äî If no redemption be made within one (1) year from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale, the purchaser is entitled to a conveyance and possession of the property; or, if so redeemed whenever sixty (60) days have elapsed and no other redemption has been made, and notice thereof given, and the time for redemption has expired, the last redemptioner is entitled to the conveyance and possession; but in all cases the judgment obligor shall have the entire period of one (1) year from the date of the registration of the sale to redeem the property. The deed shall be executed by the officer making the sale or by his successor in office, and in the latter case shall have the same validity as though the officer making the sale had continued in office and executed it.
<br /><br />
Upon the expiration of the right of redemption, the purchaser or redemptioner shall be substituted to and acquire all the rights, title, interest and claim of the judgment obligor to the property as of the time of the levy. The possession of the property shall be given to the purchaser or last redemptioner by the same officer unless a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment obligor. (35a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 34. Recovery of price if sale not effective; revival of judgment.</em> ‚Äî If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his successor in interest, fails to recover the possession thereof, or is evicted therefrom, in consequence of irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale, or because the judgment has been reversed or set aside, or because the property sold was exempt from execution, or because a third person has vindicated his claim to the property, he may on motion in the same action or in a separate action recover from the judgment obligee the price paid, with interest, or so much thereof as has not been delivered to the judgment obligor; or he may, on motion, have the original judgment revived in his name for the whole price with interest, or so much thereof as has been delivered to the judgment obligor. The judgment so revived shall have the same force and effect as an original judgment would have as of the date of the revival and no more. (36a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 35. Right to contribution or reimbursement.</em> ‚Äî When property liable to an execution against several persons is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the judgment is satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of the property of one of them, or one of them pays, without a sale, more than his proportion, he may compel a contribution from the others; and when a judgment is upon an obligation of one of them, as security for another, and the surety pays the amount, or any part thereof, either by sale of his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from the principal.

</p><br />

(39a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 38. Enforcement of attendance and conduct of examination.</em> ‚Äî A party or other person may be compelled, by an order or subpoena, to a attend before the court or commissioner to testify as provided in the two preceding sections, and upon failure to obey such other or subpoena or to be sworn, or to answer as a witness or to subscribe his disposition, may be punished for contempt as in other cases.

All examinations and answers before a court a commissioner must be under oath, and when a corporation or other juridical entity answers, it must be on the oath of an authorized officer or agent thereof. (40a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 39. Obligor may pay execution against obligee.</em> ‚Äî After a writ of execution against property has been issued, a person indebted to the judgment obligor may pay to the sheriff holding the writ of execution the amount of his debt or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment, in the manner prescribed in section 9 of this Rule, and the sheriff‚Äôs receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the amount so paid or directed to be credited by the judgment obligee on the execution. (41a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 40. Order for application of property and income to satisfaction of judgment.</em> ‚Äî The court may order any property of the judgment obligor, or money due him, not exempt from execution, in the hands of either himself or another person, or of a corporation or other juridical entity, to be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment, subject to any prior rights over such property.
<br /><br />

(42a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 41. Appointment of receiver.</em> ‚Äî The court may appoint a receiver of the property of the judgment obligor; and it may also forbid a transfer or other disposition of, or any interference with, the property of the judgment obligor not exempt from execution. (43a)

Proceedings when indebtedness denied or another person claims the property.</em> ‚Äî If it appears that a person or corporation, alleged to have property of the judgment obligor or to be indebted to him, claims an in the property adverse to him or denies the debt, the court may authorize, by an order made to that effect, the judgment obligee to institute an action against such person or corporation for the recovery of such interest or debt, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt with one hundred twenty (120) days from notice of the order, and may punish disobedience of such order as for contempt. Such order may be modified or vacated at any time by the court which issued it, or by the court in which the action is brought, upon such terms as may be just. (45a)
</p><br />

(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration, or the condition, status or relationship of the person; however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;

(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and

(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)
</pre>

<p><em>SEC. 48. Effect of foreign judgments or final orders.</em> ‚Äî The effect of a judgment or final order of a tribunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to render the judgment or final order is as follows:
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) In case of a judgment or final order upon a specific thing, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing; and

(b) In case of a judgment or final order against a person, the judgment or final order is presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties and their successors in interest by a subsequent title.
</pre></p><br />
<p>In either case, the judgment or final order may be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact. (50a)

</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1.

Several writs may be issued at the same time to the sheriffs of the courts of different judicial regions. (2a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Affidavit and bond required.</em> ‚Äî An order of attachment shall be granted only when it appears by the affidavit of the applicant, or of some other person who personally knows the facts, that a sufficient cause of action exists, that the case is one of those mentioned in section 1 hereof, that there is no other sufficient security for the claim sought to be enforced by the action, and that the amount due to the applicant, or the value of the property the possession of which he is entitled to recover, is as much as the sum for which the order is granted above all legal counterclaims. The affidavit, and the bond required by the next succeeding section, must be duly filed with the court before the order issues. (3a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. Condition of applicant‚Äôs bond.</em> ‚Äî The party applying for the order must thereafter give a bond executed to the adverse party in the amount fixed by the court in its order granting the issuance of the writ, conditioned that the latter will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the adverse party and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was not entitled thereto. (4a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. Manner of attaching property.</em> ‚Äî The sheriff enforcing the writ shall without delay and with all reasonable diligence attach, to await judgment and execution in the action, only so much of the property in the Philippines of the party against whom the writ is issued, not exempt from execution, as may be sufficient to satisfy the applicant‚Äôs demand, unless the former makes a deposit with the court from which the writ is issued, or gives a counter-bond executed to the applicant, in an amount equal to the bond fixed by the court in the order of attachment or to the value of the property to be attached, exclusive of costs. No levy on attachment pursuant to the writ issued under section 2 hereof shall be enforced unless it is preceded, or contemporaneously accompanied, by service of summons, together with a copy of the complaint, the application for attachment, the applicant‚Äôs affidavit and bond, and the order and writ of attachment, on the defendant within the Philippines.
<br /><br />
The requirement of prior or contemporaneous service of summons shall not apply where the summons could not be served personally or by substituted service despite diligent efforts, or the defendant is a resident of the Philippines temporarily absent therefrom, or the defendant is a non-resident of the Philippines, or the action is one <i>in rem</i> or <i>quasi in rem</i>.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 7. Attachment of real and personal property; recording thereof.</em> ‚Äî Real and personal property shall be attached by the sheriff executing the writ in the following manner:
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) Real property, or growing crops thereon, or any interest therein, standing upon the record of the registry of deeds of the province in the name of the party against whom attachment is issued, or not appearing at all upon such records, or belonging to the party against whom attachment is issued and held by any other person, or standing on the records of the registry of deeds in the name of any other person, by filing with the registry of deeds a copy of the order, together with a description of the property attached, and a notice that it is attached, or that such real property and any interest therein held by or standing in the name of such other person are attached, and by leaving a copy of such order, description, and notice with the occupant of the property, if any, or with such other person or his agent if found within the province. Where the property has been brought under the operation of either the Land Registration Act or the Property Registration Decree, the notice shall contain a reference to the number of the certificate of title, the volume and page in the registration book where the certificate is registered, and the registered owner or owners thereof.
The registrar of deeds must index attachments filed under this section in the names of the applicant, the adverse party, or the person by whom the property is held or in whose name it stands in the records. If the attachment is not claimed on the entire area of the land covered by the certificate of title, a description sufficiently accurate for the identification of the land or interest to be affected shall be included in the registration of such attachment;

(b) Personal property capable of manual delivery, by taking and safely keeping it in his custody, after issuing the corresponding receipt therefor;

(c) Stocks or shares, or an interest in stocks or shares, of any corporation or company, by leaving with the president or managing agent thereof, a copy of the writ, and a notice stating that the stock or interest of the party against whom the attachment is issued is attached in pursuance of such writ;

(d) Debts and credits, including bank deposits, financial interest, royalties, commissions and other personal property not capable of manual delivery, by leaving with the person owing such debts, or having in his possession or under his control, such credits or other personal property, or with his agent, a copy of the writ, and notice that the debts owing by him to the party against whom attachment is issued, and the credits and other personal property in his possession, or under his control, belonging to said party, are attached in pursuance of such writ;

(e) The interest of the party against whom attachment is issued in property belonging to the estate of the decedent, whether as heir, legatee, or devisee, by serving the executor or administrator or other personal representative of the decedent with a copy of the writ and notice that said interest is attached. A copy of said writ of attachment of said notice shall also be filed in the office of the clerk of the court in which said estate is being settled and served upon the heir, legatee or devisee concerned.
</pre></p><br />
<p>If the property sought to be attached is in custodia legis, a copy of the writ of attachment shall be filed with the proper court or quasi-judicial agency, and notice of the attachment served upon the custodian of such property. (7a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 8. Effect of attachment of debts, credits and all other similar personal property.</em> ‚Äî All persons having in their possession or under their control any credits or other similar personal property belonging to the party against whom attachment is issued, or owing any debts to him, at the time of service upon them of the copy of the writ of attachment and notice as provided in the last preceding section, shall be liable to the applicant for the amount of such credits, debts or other similar personal property, until the attachment is discharged, or any judgment recovered by him is satisfied, unless such property is delivered or transferred, or such debts are paid, to the clerk, sheriff, or other proper officer of the court issuing the attachment. (8a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 9. Effect of attachment of interest in property belonging to the estate of a decedent. ‚Äî The attachment of the interest of an heir, legatee, or devisee in the property belonging to the estate of a decedent shall not impair the powers of the executor, administrator, or other persona representative of the decedent over such property for t e purpose of administration. Such personal representative, however, shall report the attachment to the court when any petition for distribution is filed, and in the order made upon such petition, distribution may be awarded to such heir, legatee, or devisee, but the property attached s be ordered delivered to the sheriff making the levy, subject to the claim of such heir, legatee, or devisee, or any person claiming under him. (9a)
&lt;/p&gt;<br />

<p><em>SEC. 10. Examination of party whose property is attached and persons indebted to him or controlling his property; delivery of propery to sheriff.</em> ‚Äî Any person owing debts to the party whose property is attached or having in his possession or under his control any credit or other personal property belonging to such party, may be required to attend before the court in which the action is pending, or before a commissioner appointed by the court, and be examined on oath respecting the same. The party whose property is attached may also be required to attend for the purpose of giving information respecting his property, and may be examined on oath. The court may, after such examination, order personal property capable of manual delivery belonging to him, in the possession of the person so required to attend before the court, to be delivered to the clerk of the court or sheriff on such terms as may be just, having reference to any lien thereon or claim against the same, to await the judgment in the action. (10a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 11. When attached property may be sold after levy on attachment and before entry of judgment.</em> ‚Äî Whenever it shall be made to appear to the court in which the action is pending, upon hearing with notice to both parties, that the property attached is perishable, or that the interests of all the parties to the action will be subserved by the sale thereof, the court may order such property to be sold at public auction in such manner as it may direct, and the proceeds of such sale to be deposited in court to abide the judgment in the action. (11a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 12. Discharge of attachment upon giving counter-bond.</em> ‚Äî After a writ of attachment has been enforced, the party whose property has been attached, or the person appearing on his behalf, may move for the discharge of the attachment wholly or in part on the security given. The court shall, after due notice and hearing, order the discharge of the attachment if the movant makes a cash deposit, or files a counter-bond executed to the attaching party with the clerk of the court where the application is made, in amount equal to that fixed by the court in the order of attachment, exclusive of costs. But if the attachment is sought to be discharged with respect to a particular property, the counter-bond shall be equal to the value of that property as determined by the court. In either case, the cash deposit or the counter-bond shall secure the payment of any judgment that the attaching party may recover in the action. A notice of the deposit shall forthwith be served on the attaching party. Upon the discharge of an attachment in accordance with the provisions of this section, the property attached, or the proceeds of any sale thereof, shall be delivered to the party making the deposit or giving the counter-bond, or to the person appearing on his behalf, the deposit or counter-bond aforesaid standing in place of the property so released. Should such counter-bond for any reason be found to be, or become insufficient, and the party furnishing the same fail to file an additional counter-bond, the attaching party may apply for a new order of attachment. (12a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 13. Discharge of attachment on other grounds.</em> ‚Äî The party whose property has been ordered attached may file a motion with the court in which the action is pending, before or after levy or even after the release of the attached property, for an order to set aside or discharge the attachment on the ground that the same was improperly or irregularly issued or enforced, or that the bond is insufficient. If the attachment is excessive, the discharge shall be limited to the excess. If the motion be made on affidavits on the part of the movant but not otherwise, the attaching party may oppose the motion by counter-affidavits or other evidence in addition to that on which the attachment was made. After due notice and hearing, the court shall order the setting aside or the corresponding discharge of the attachment if it appears that it was improperly or irregularly issued or enforced, or that the bond is insufficient, or that the attachment is excessive, and the defect is not cured forthwith. (13a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 14. Proceedings where property claimed by third person.</em> ‚Äî If the property attached is claimed by any person other than the party against whom attachment had been issued or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto, or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and serves such affidavit upon the sheriff while the latter has possession of the attached property, and a copy thereof upon the attaching party, the sheriff shall not be bound to keep the property under attachment, unless the attaching party or his agent, on demand of the sheriff, shall file a bond approved by the court to indemnify the third-party claimant in a sum not less than the value of the property levied upon. In case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be decided by the court issuing the writ of attachment. No claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be enforced against the bond unless the action therefor is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.
<br /><br />
The sheriff shall not be liable for damages for the taking or keeping of such property, to any such third-party claimant, if such bond shall be filed. Nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any third person from vindicating his claim to the property, or prevent the attaching party from claiming damages against a third-party claimant who filed a frivolous or plainly spurious claim, in the same or a separate action.
<br /><br />
When the writ of attachment is issued hi favor of the Republic of the Philippines, or any officer duly representing it, the filing of such bond shall not be required, and in case the sheriff is sued for damages as a result of the attachment, he shall be represented by the Solicitor General, and if held liable therefor, the actual damages judged by the court shall be paid by the National Treasurer out of the funds to be appropriated for the purpose. (14a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 15. Satisfaction of judgment out of property attached; return of sheriff.</em> ‚Äî If judgment be recovered by the attaching party and execution issue thereon, the sheriff may cause the judgment to be satisfied out of the property attached, if it be sufficient for that purpose in the following manner:
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) By paying to the judgment obligee the proceeds of all sales of perishable or other property sold in pursuance of the order of the court, or so much as shall be necessary to satisfy the judgment;

(b) If any balance remains due, by selling so much of the property, real or personal, as may be necessary to satisfy the balance, if enough for that purpose remain in the sheriff's hands, or in those of the clerk of the court;

(c) By collecting from all persons having in their possession credits belonging to the judgment obligor, or owing debts to the latter at the time of the attachment of such credits or debts, the amount of such credits and debts as determined by the court in the action, and stated in the judgment, and paying the proceeds of such collection over to the judgment obligee.
</pre></p><br />
<p>The sheriff shall forthwith make a return in writing to the court of his proceedings under this section and furnish the parties with copies thereof. (15a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 16. Balance due collected upon an execution; excess delivered to judgment obligor.</em> ‚Äî If after realizing upon all the property attached, including the proceeds of any debts or credits collected, and applying the proceeds to the satisfaction of the judgment, less the expenses of proceedings upon the judgment, any balance shall remain due, the sheriff must proceed to collect such balance as upon ordinary execution. Whenever the judgment shall have been paid, the sheriff, upon reasonable demand, must return to the judgment obligor the attached property remaining in his hands, and any proceeds of the sale of the property attached not applied to the judgment. (16a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 17. Recovery upon the counter-bond.</em> ‚Äî When the judgment has become executory, the surety or sureties on any counter-bond given pursuant to the provisions of this Rule to secure the payment of the judgment shall become charged on such counter-bond and bound to pay the judgment obligee upon demand the amount due under the judgment, which amount may be recovered from such surety or sureties after notice and summary hearing in the same action. (17a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 18. Disposition of money deposited.</em> ‚Äî Where the party against whom attachment had been issued has deposited money instead of giving counter-bond, it shall be applied under the direction of the court to the satisfaction of any judgment rendered in favor of the attaching party, and after satisfying the judgment the balance shall be refunded to the depositor or his assignee. If the judgment is in favor of the party against whom attachment was issued, the whole sum deposited must be refunded to him or his assignee. (18a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 19. Disposition of attached property where judgment is for party against whom attachment was issued.</em> ‚Äî If judgment be rendered against the attaching party, all the proceeds of sales and money collected or received by the sheriff, under the order of attachment, and all property attached remaining in any such officer‚Äôs hands, shall be delivered to the party against whom attachment was issued, and the order of attachment discharged. (19a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 20. Claim for damages on account of improper, irregular or excessive attachment.</em> ‚Äî An application for damages on account of improper, irregular or excessive attachment must be filed before the trial or before appeal is perfected or before the judgment becomes executory, with due notice to the attaching party and his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to damages and the amount thereof. Such damages may be awarded only after proper hearing and shall be included in the judgment on the main case.
<br /><br />
If the judgment of the appellate court be favorable to the party against whom the attachment was issued, he must claim damages sustained during the pendency of the appeal by filing an application in the appellate court, with notice to the party in whose favor the attachment was issued or his surety or sureties, before the judgment of the appellate court becomes executory. The appellate court may allow the application to be heard and decided by the trial court.
<br /><br />
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the party against whom the attachment was issued from recovering in the same action the damages awarded to him from any property of the attaching party not exempt from execution should the bond or deposit given by the latter be insufficient or fail to fully satisfy the award. (20a)
</p><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part58">RULE 58: PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
</h3><br />

<p><em>SECTION 1. Preliminary injunction defined; classes.</em> ‚Äî A preliminary injunction is an order granted at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order, requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to refrain from a particular act or acts. It may also require the performance of a particular act or acts, in which case it shall be known as a preliminary mandatory injunction. (1a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 2. Who may grant preliminary injunction.</em> ‚Äî A preliminary injunction may be granted by the court where the action or proceeding is pending. If the action or proceeding is pending in the Court of Appeals or in the Supreme Court, it may be issued by said court or any member thereof. (2a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Grounds for issuance of preliminary injunction.</em> ‚Äî A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established:
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually;

(b) That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or

(c) That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual. (3a)
</pre>
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. Verified application and bond for preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order.</em> ‚Äî A preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order may be granted only when:
<br /><br />
<pre>
(a) The application in the action or proceeding is verified, and shows facts entitling the applicant to the relief demanded; and

(b) Unless exempted by the court, the applicant files with the court where the action or proceeding is pending, a bond executed to the party or person enjoined, in an amount to be fixed by the court, to the effect that the applicant will pay to such party or person all damages which he may sustain by reason of the injunction or temporary restraining order if the court should finally decide that the applicant was not entitled thereto. Upon approval of the requisite bond, a writ of preliminary injunction shall be issued. (4a)

(c) When an application for a writ of preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order is included in a complaint or any initiatory pleading, the case, if filed in a multiple-sala court, shall be raffled only after notice to and in the presence of the adverse party or the person to be enjoined. In any event, such notice shall be preceded, or contemporaneously accompanied, by service of summons, together with a copy of the complaint or initiatory pleading and the applicant‚Äôs affidavit and bond, upon the adverse party in the Philippines.
However, where the summons could not be served personally or by substituted service despite diligent efforts or the adverse party is a resident of the Philippines temporarily absent therefrom or is a nonresident thereof, the requirement of prior or contemporaneous service of summons shall not apply;

(d) The application for a temporary restraining order shall thereafter be acted upon only after all parties are heard in a summary hearing which shall be conducted within twenty-four (24) hours after the sheriff's return of service and/or the records are received by the branch selected by raffle and to which the records shall be transmitted immediately.
</pre>
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. Preliminary injunction not granted without notice; exception.</em> ‚Äî No preliminary injunction shall be granted without hearing and prior notice to the party or persons sought to be enjoined. If it shall appear from facts shown by affidavits or by the verified application that great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant before the matter can be heard on notice, the court to which the application for preliminary injunction was made, may issue <i>ex parte</i> a temporary restraining order to be effective only for a period of twenty (20) days from service on the party or person sought to be enjoined, except as herein provided. Within the twenty-day period, the court must order said party or person to show cause, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted. The court shall also determine, within the same period, whether or not the preliminary injunction shall be granted, and accordingly issue the corresponding order.
<br /><br />
However, subject to the provisions of the preceding sections, if the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the executive judge of a multiple-sala court or the presiding judge of a single-sala court may issue <i>ex parte</i> a temporary restraining order effective for only seventy-two (72) hours from issuance, but shall immediately comply with the provisions of the next preceding section as to service of summons and the documents to be served therewith. Thereafter, within the aforesaid seventy-two (72) hours, the judge before whom the case is pending shall conduct a summary hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order shall be extended until the application for preliminary injunction can be heard. In no case shall the total period of effectivity of the temporary restraining order exceed twenty (20) days, including the original seventy-two hours provided herein.
<br /><br />
In the event that the application for preliminary injunction is denied or not resolved within the said period, the temporary restraining order is deemed automatically vacated. The effectivity of a temporary restraining order is not extendible without need of any judicial declaration to that effect, and no court shall have authority to extend or renew the same on the same ground for which it was issued.
<br /><br />
However, if issued by the Court of Appeals or a member thereof, the temporary restraining order shall be effective for sixty (60) days from service on the party or person sought to be enjoined.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3. Order.</em> ‚Äî Upon the filing of such affidavit and approval of the bond, the court shall issue an order and the corresponding writ of <i>replevin</i> describing the personal property alleged to be wrongfully detained and requiring the sheriff forthwith to take such property into his custody.

If after such hearing or submission of memoranda or the expiration of the period for the filing thereof the court finds that the allegations of the petition are true, it shall render judgment for the relief prayed for or to which the petitioner is entitled.
<br />
The court, however, may dismiss the petition if it finds the same to be patently without merit, prosecuted manifestly for delay, or that the questions raised therein are too unsubstantial to require consideration. (8a)

<p><em>SEC. 9. Service and enforcement of order or judgment.</em> ‚Äî A certified copy of the judgment rendered in accordance with the last preceding section shall be served upon the court, quasi-judicial agency, tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person concerned in such manner as the court may direct, and disobedience thereto shall be punished as contempt.

If the title to any property sought to be expropriated appears to be in the Republic of the Philippines, although occupied by private individuals, or if the title is otherwise obscure or doubtful so that the plaintiff cannot with accuracy or certainty specify who are the real owners, averment to that effect shall be made in the complaint. (1a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 2. Entry of plaintiff upon depositing value with authorized government depositary.</em> ‚Äî Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter and after due notice to the defendant, the plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon the possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such bank subject to the orders of the court. Such deposit shall be in money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes the deposit of a certificate of deposit of a government bank of the Republic of the Philippines payable on demand to the authorized government depositary.If personal property is involved, its value shall be provisionally ascertained and the amount to be deposited shall be promptly fixed by the court.After such deposit is made the court shall order the sheriff or other proper officer to forthwith place the plaintiff in possession of the property involved and promptly submit a report thereof to the court with service of copies to the parties.

</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 3.

Thereafter, he shall be entitled to notice of all proceedings affecting the same. If a defendant has any objection to the filing of or the allegations in the complaint, or any objection or defense to the taking of his property, he shall serve his answer within the time stated in the summons. The answer shall specifically designate or identify the property in which he claims to have an interest, state the nature and extent of the interest claimed, and adduce all his objections and defenses to the taking of his property. No counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party complaint shall be alleged or allowed in the answer or any subsequent pleading. A defendant waives all defenses and objections not so alleged but the court, in the interest of justice, may permit amendments to the answer to be made not later than ten (10) days from the filing thereof. However, at the trial of the issue of just compensation, whether or not a defendant has previously appeared or answered, he may present evidence as to the amount of the compensation to be paid for his property, and he may share in the distribution of the award. (n)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 4. Order of expropriation.</em> ‚Äî If the objections to and the defenses against the right of the plaintiff to expropriate the property are overruled, or when no party appears to defend as required by this Rule, the court may issue an order of expropriation declaring that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be expropriated, for the public use or purpose described in the complaint, upon the payment of just compensation to be determined as of the date of the taking of the property or the filing of the complaint, whichever came first.
<br />
A final order sustaining the right to expropriate the property may be appealed by any party aggrieved thereby. Such appeal, however, shall not prevent the court from determining the just compensation to be paid.
<br />
After the rendition of such an order, the plaintiff shall not be permitted to dismiss or discontinue the proceeding except on such terms as the court deems just and equitable. (4a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5.

<p><em>SEC. 6. Proceedings by commissioners.</em> ‚Äî Before entering upon the performance of their duties, the commissioners shall take and subscribe an oath that they will faithfully perform their duties as commissioners, which oath shall be filed in court with the other proceedings in the case.

The commissioners shall assess the consequential damages to the property not taken and deduct from such consequential damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owner from the public use or purpose of the property taken, the operation of its franchise by the corporation or the carrying on of the business of the corporation or person taking the property. But in no case shall the consequential benefits assessed exceed the consequential damages assessed, or the owner be deprived of the actual value of his property so taken. (6a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 7. Report by commissioners and judgment thereupon. ‚Äî The court may order the commissioners to report when any particular portion of the real estate shall have been passed upon by them, and may render judgment upon such partial report, and direct the commissioners to proceed with their work as to subsequent portions of the property sought to be expropriated, and may from time to time so deal with such property. The commissioners shall make a full and accurate report to the court of all their proceedings, and such proceedings shall not be effectual until the court shall have accepted their report and rendered judgment in accordance with their recommendations Except as otherwise expressly ordered by the court, such report shall be filed within sixty (60) days from the date the commissioners were notified of their appointment, which time may be extended in the discretion of the court. Upon the filing of such report, the clerk of the court shall serve copies thereof on all interested parties, with notice that they are allowed ten (10) days within which to file objections to the findings of the report, if they so desire.

(8a)
&lt;/p&gt;<br />

<p><em>SEC. 9. Uncertain ownership; conflicting claims. ‚Äî If the ownership of the property taken is uncertain, or there are conflicting claims to any part thereof, the court may order any sum or sums awarded as compensation for the property to be paid to the court for the benefit of the person adjudged in the same proceeding to be entitled thereto. But the judgment shall require the payment of the sum or sums awarded to either the defendant or the court before the plaintiff can enter upon the property, or retain it for the public use or purpose if entry has already been made. (9a)
&lt;/p&gt;<br />

<p><em>SEC. 10. Rights of plaintiff after judgment and payment.</em> ‚Äî Upon payment by the plaintiff to the defendant of the compensation fixed by the judgment, with legal interest thereon from the taking of the possession of the property, or after tender to him of the amount so fixed and payment of the costs, the plaintiff shall have the right to enter upon the property expropriated and to appropriate it for the public use or purpose defined in the judgment, or to retain it should he have taken immediate possession thereof under the provisions of section 2 hereof. If the defendant and his counsel absent themselves from the court, or decline to receive the amount tendered, the same shall be ordered to be deposited in court and such deposit shall have the same effect as actual payment thereof to the defendant or the person ultimately adjudged entitled thereto. (10a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 11. Entry not delayed by appeal; effect of reversal.</em> ‚Äî The right of the plaintiff to enter upon the property of the defendant and appropriate the same for public use or purpose shall not be delayed by an appeal from the judgment. But if the appellate court determines that plaintiff has no right of expropriation, judgment shall be rendered ordering the Regional Trial Court to forthwith enforce the restoration to the defendant of the possession of the property, and to determine the damages which the defendant sustained and may recover by reason of the possession taken by the plaintiff. (11a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 12. Costs, by whom paid.</em> ‚Äî The fees of the commissioners shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the proceedings. All costs, except those of rival claimants litigating their claims, shall be paid by the plaintiff, unless an appeal is taken by the owner of the property and the judgment is affirmed, in which event the costs of the appeal shall be paid by the owner. (12a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 13. Recording judgment, and its effect. ‚Äî The judgment entered in expropriation proceedings shall state definitely, by an adequate description, the particular property or interest therein expropriated, and the nature of the public use or purpose for which it is expropriated. When real estate is expropriated, a certified copy of such judgment shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of the place in which the property is situated, and its effect shall be to vest in the plaintiff the title to the real estate so described for such public use or purpose. (13a)
&lt;/p&gt;<br />

<p><em>SEC. 14. Power of guardian in such proceedings. ‚Äî The guardian or guardian ad litem of a minor or of a person judicially declared to be incompetent may, with the approval of the court first had, do and perform on behalf of his ward any act, matter, or thing respecting the expropriation for public use or purpose of property belonging to such minor or person judicially declared to be incompetent, which such minor or person judicially declared to be incompetent could do in such proceedings if he were of age or competent.

(4a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 5. How sale to proceed in case the debt is not all due.</em> ‚Äî If the debt for which the mortgage or encumbrance was held is not all due as provided in the judgment, as soon as a sufficient portion of the property has been sold to pay the total amount and the costs due, the sale shall terminate; and afterwards, as often as more becomes due for principal or interest and other valid charges, the court may, on motion, order more to be sold. But if the property cannot be sold in portions without prejudice to the parties, the whole shall be ordered to be sold in the first instance, and the entire debt and costs shall be paid, if the proceeds of the sale be sufficient therefor, there being a rebate of interest where such rebate is proper.

<br />
If the property is not redeemed, the final deed of sale executed by the sheriff in favor of the purchaser at the foreclosure sale shall be registered with the registry of deeds; whereupon the certificate of title in the name of the mortgagor shall be cancelled and a new one issued in the name of the purchaser.

Review of judgment or final order; bond for stay.</em> ‚Äî The judgment or final order of a court in a case of indirect contempt may be, appealed to the proper court as in criminal cases. But execution of the judgment or final order shall not be suspended until a bond is filed by the person adjudged in contempt, in an amount fixed by the court from which the appeal is taken, conditioned that if the appeal be decided against him he will abide by and perform the judgment or final order. (10a)
</p><br />

<p><em>SEC. 12. Contempt against quasi-judicial entities.</em> ‚Äî Unless otherwise provided by law, this Rule shall apply to contempt committed against persons, entities, bodies or agencies exercising quasi-judicial functions, or shall have suppletory effect to such rules as they may have adopted pursuant to authority granted to them by law to punish for contempt.
