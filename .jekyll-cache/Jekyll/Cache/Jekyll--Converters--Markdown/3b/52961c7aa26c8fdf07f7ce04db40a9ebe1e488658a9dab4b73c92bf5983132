<h1>How to Compute for Legal Periods</h1>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="part1">Introduction</h2>

<br /><br />

<p>
"Better late than never" applies to many things: being late rather than being absent, paying bills late rather than not paying them at all, and slowing down rather than quitting altogether. However in the legal system, if you’re late, you can only pray that the authorities will be lenient towards you: just being a day late and you might see months and even years of hard work reduced to nothing at all.
<br /><br />
Being on time is absolutely important not just because it is required by law, but more than that, there are practical considerations for it. In case of crimes, witnesses and evidence might be harder to track if the trail has gone cold so to speak. In case of court trials, the courts will not efficiently function if no one files their actions on time. Cases will not be closed, and justice will not be served.
<br /><br />
The importance of learning how to compute properly for legal periods is important even outside courts. Since there are laws telling how to compute for legal periods, the same manner of computation also applies to all contracts - whether verbal or oral. Taken to an extreme, the simple example of borrowing a book from the library is covered by legal periods, although not so obvious.
</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="part2">How to Compute for Legal Periods</h2>

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part2.1">LEGAL SOURCES</h3>

<br /><br />

<p>There are three legal articles that cover legal periods.
<br /><br />

1. New Civil Code, Article 13<sup>1</sup>
<br /><br />
<pre>
<em>ARTICLE 13.</em> When the laws speak of years, months, days or nights, it shall be understood that years are of three hundred sixty-five days each; months, of thirty days; days, of twenty-four hours; and nights from sunset to sunrise.

If months are designated by their name, they shall be computed by the number of days which they respectively have.

In computing a period, the first day shall be excluded, and the last day included. (7a)
</pre></p><br />

<p>2. Rules of Court, Rule 22<sup>2</sup>
<br /><br />
<pre>
<em>SECTION 1. How to compute time.</em> — In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included. If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day. (1)

<em>SEC. 2. Effect of interruption.</em> — Should an act be done which effectively interrupts the running of the period, the allowable period after such interruption shall start to run on the day after notice of the cessation of the cause thereof.

The day of the act that caused the interruption shall be excluded in the computation of the period. (2)
</pre></p><br />

<p>3. Revised Administrative Code, Section 31<sup>3</sup>
<br /><br />
<pre>
<em>SECTION 31. Legal Periods.</em> — ”Year” shall be understood to be twelve calendar months; “month” of thirty days, unless it refers to a specific calendar month in which case it shall be computed according to the number of days the specific month contains; “day,” to a day of twenty-four hours; and “night,” from sunset to sunrise.
</pre></p><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part2.2">LEGAL HOLIDAYS</h3>

<br /><br />

<p>The Rules of Court as cited above mentions “legal holidays in the place where the court sits”. Legal holidays is composed of three types of holidays enacted by law:
<br /><br />
<pre>
1. Regular holidays
2. Special (Non-working) holidays
3. Local Holidays (Quezon City day, Pasig City day, etc.)
</pre></p><br />

<br /><br />

<p>The list of regular and special holidays can be found in the <a class="externalLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/nationwide-holidays/2020/">Official Gazette</a><sup>4</sup>. As for the local holidays, your best bet is to call or visit the court itself.
<br /><br />
Now that we have cited our legal bases, let’s move on to how to compute for legal periods. 
</p>

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part2.3">COMPUTATION</h3>

<br /><br />

<p>1. <em>Days</em>
<br /><br />
<pre>
a. “xxx the first day shall be excluded, and the last day included.” To be on the safe side, just start counting from zero. Once you’re comfortable with counting from 0, you’ll notice that it’s just like addition.

b. By default, “days” mean “calendar days”. This means that Saturdays, Sundays, and Legal Holidays are included in the count. If it states “working days” or “business days”, then those three aren’t counted.
</pre></p><br />

<p>2. <em>Months</em>
<br /><br />
<pre>
a. Keep the date intact and change the year and month as you see fit. They are all thirty days if they are just labelled as “months”.

<img class="pictureInPost" src="/assets/images/0003/Post0002.jpg" alt="Months are usually counted as 30 days." />

b. If the month is specifically named, then the count is based on its specific number of days.

<img class="pictureInPost" src="/assets/images/0003/Post0003.jpg" alt="You count the specific number of days of a month if it is specifically named." />

c. As much as possible just use “months” in any contract you enter into. It’s a waste of time to add up 30, 31, 28 and 29.
</pre></p><br />

<p>3. <em>Years</em>
<br /><br />
<pre>
Years are counted as 12 months, NOT 365 days, as laid down in Section 31 of the Revised Administrative Code. This is clarified in the cases of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Primetown Property Group<sup>5</sup> and Philhealth v COA<sup>6</sup>.

Keep the month and date intact, then just add to the years.

If you want to make sure, break down the years into twelve months and follow instructions to months as stated above.

The laws do not distinguish between leap years and regular years, so the computation is just the same for both.

</pre></p><br />

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part2.4">PERIOD IS INTERRUPTED</h3>

<br /><br />

<p>What if there’s a global pandemic that caused business establishments and courts to close? In some instances, an action or event may legally interrupt a period. When a period is interrupted, you pause your count. Be careful though since not all actions interrupt a period; only certain acts listed in the laws can interrupt a period.

<br /><br />

As for its computation, as stated in the Rules of Court, the anchor for an interruption of period is “notice of cessation of the cause”. Staying consistent with how to compute for legal periods above, the day of notice of the cessation of the cause is not included in the count. Note that the rule did not state, “date of receipt of notice”. Because of that you have to be updated on the cause that interrupted the legal period.

<br /><br />

</p>

<br /><br />

<h3 id="part2.5">EXTENSION OF PERIOD</h3>

<br /><br />

<p>When it  comes to extensions of periods, the important thing to note is whether the period ends on a Sunday, Sunday, or Legal Holiday.

<br /><br />

Periods ending on a Saturday, Sunday, or Legal Holiday is governed by the Rules of Court. Specifically, the last paragraph of Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court state that “if the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day”. Essentially, when your anchor falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Legal Holiday, you should file on the next working day. This does not mean that the end date of your legal period moved. It still is the original end date, it’s just that the courts were closed that day so you can only file it on the next working day. Your anchor for an extension of period will always be the date when the original period ended regardless if it was a regular day, weekend, or holiday.

<br /><br />

<img class="pictureInPost" src="/assets/images/0003/Post0006.jpg" alt="When the period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or Legal Holiday, you file on the next working day." />

<br /><br />

Let’s say the period you’re supposed to pay your rent is on a Sunday. Come Monday, you asked for an extension to pay your rent because you didn’t have work during a global pandemic lockdown. Your landlord granted an extension of 30 days. The 30 day extension is counted from Sunday when you were supposed to pay your rent, not on Monday when you asked for an extension. To repeat, your anchor for an extension of period will always be when the original period ended. The consistency of anchors for an extension of period is clarified in the case of Montajes vs. People<sup>7</sup>. In that case, the parties could not agree on the start date of the motion for extension. Was it on the Saturday where the period originally ended, or was it the next working day? The Supreme Court stated that the extension should start from the original end date of the period based on A.M. No. 00-2-14-SC<sup>8</sup> where it clarified the interpretation of Rule 22 of the Rules of Court<sup>9</sup>.
