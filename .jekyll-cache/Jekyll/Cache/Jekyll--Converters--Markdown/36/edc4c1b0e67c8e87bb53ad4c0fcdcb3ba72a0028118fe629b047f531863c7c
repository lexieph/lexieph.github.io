<h1>2019 LABOR BAR EXAM: PRESCRIPTION</h1>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="part1"> QUESTION </h2>
<br />
<p>
A.10 For purposes of prescription, within what periods from the time the cause of action accrued should the following cases be filed:<br />
(a) Money claims arising from employer-employee relations (1%)<br />
(b) Illegal dismissal (1%)<br />
(d) Offenses under the Labor Code (1%)<br />
(e) Illegal recruitment (1%)<br /><br /><br /><br />
</p>

<h2 id="part2"> ANSWER AS OF JANUARY 8, 2020 </h2>
<br />
<p>
Money claims arising from employer-employee relations - within 3 years from the time the cause of action occurred.[1] However, if the money claim is based on illegal dismissal, like backwages and damages, then the prescriptive period for illegal dismissal applies.[2]<br /><br />

Illegal dismissal - within 4 years from the time the cause of action occurred based on the Callanta doctrine[3] and Article 1146 of the New Civil Code[4].<br /><br />

Offenses under the Labor Code - within 3 years from the time the cause of action occurred.[5]<br /><br />

Illegal recruitment - within 5 years from the time the cause of action occurred. However, if the illegal recruitment involves economic sabotage, then the period is increased to within 20 years.[6]<br /><br /><br /><br />
</p>


<h2 id="part3"> NOTES </h2>
<br />
<p>
The important doctrine to cite in this question is the Callanta doctrine in the case Callanta vs. Carnation Philippines, Inc., (145 SCRA 268, October 28, 1986)[7]. This doctrine explains why illegal dismissal is not considered an offense under the Labor Code.<br /><br />

Broadly speaking, an ‚Äúoffense‚Äù in the Labor Code is an act declared by the special law to be illegal, such as strikes or lockouts. For example, if we take away the Labor Code, we won‚Äôt be able to differentiate a legal strike versus an illegal strike since this is only answered by Articles 278 and 279 of the Labor Code. The same is not true for illegal dismissal. Even without the Labor Code, illegal dismissal still causes injury to another by taking away a person‚Äôs livelihood.<br /><br />

In essence, no matter the form, illegal dismissal is inherently wrong. As such, in the Callanta case, the Supreme Court considered illegal dismissal as an injury to a person rather than an offense, making it fall under the four-year prescriptive period of New Civil Code Article 1146.<br /><br /><br /><br />
